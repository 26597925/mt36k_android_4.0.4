# Google Android makefile for curl and libcurl
#
# Place the curl source (including this makefile) into external/curl/ in the
# Android source tree.  Then build them with 'make curl' or just 'make libcurl'
# from the Android root. Tested with Android 1.5 and 2.1
#
# Note: you must first create a curl_config.h file by running configure in the
# Android environment. The only way I've found to do this is tricky. Perform a
# normal Android build with libcurl in the source tree, providing the target
# "showcommands" to make. The build will eventually fail (because curl_config.h
# doesn't exist yet), but the compiler commands used to build curl will be
# shown. Now, from the external/curl/ directory, run curl's normal configure
# command with flags that match what Android itself uses. This will mean
# putting the compiler directory into the PATH, putting the -I, -isystem and
# -D options into CPPFLAGS, putting the -W, -m, -f, -O and -nostdlib options
# into CFLAGS, and putting the -Wl, -L and -l options into LIBS, along with the
# path to the files libgcc.a, crtbegin_dynamic.o, and ccrtend_android.o.
# Remember that the paths must be absolute since you will not be running
# configure from the same directory as the Android make.  The normal
# cross-compiler options must also be set. Note that the -c, -o, -MD and
# similar flags must not be set.
#
# To see all the LIBS options, you'll need to do the "showcommands" trick on an
# executable that's already buildable and watch what flags Android uses to link
# it (dhcpcd is a good choice to watch). You'll also want to add -L options to
# LIBS that point to the out/.../obj/lib/ and out/.../obj/system/lib/
# directories so that additional libraries can be found and used by curl.
#
# The end result will be a configure command that looks something like this
# (the environment variable A is set to the Android root path which makes the
# command shorter):
#
#  A=`realpath ../..` && \
#  PATH="$A/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-X/bin:$PATH" \
#  ./configure --host=arm-linux CC=arm-eabi-gcc \
#  CPPFLAGS="-I $A/system/core/include ..." \
#  CFLAGS="-nostdlib -fno-exceptions -Wno-multichar ..." \
#  LIBS="$A/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-X/lib/gcc/arm-eabi/X\
#  /interwork/libgcc.a ..."
#
# Finally, copy the file COPYING to NOTICE so that the curl license gets put
# into the right place (but see the note about this below).
